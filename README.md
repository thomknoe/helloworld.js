# helloworld.js

helloworld.js is a procedural 3D world generation tool built with React, Three.js, and ReactFlow that combines procedural generation algorithms with a visual node editor to create dynamic immersive environments. The application features a node-based authoring system for creating procedural content, first-person exploration mode for navigating generated worlds, procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise, L-System-based plant generation with customizable growth patterns, flocking behavior systems for dynamic agent animations, procedural building generation using shape grammars, and interactive flower placement driven by noise patterns. Users can seamlessly switch between author mode to design their worlds using a visual node editor and player mode to explore the generated environments in first-person. The primary users for this tool are game designers, procedural content creators, 3D artists, students learning procedural generation, and interactive media developers.

# Detailed Guide

The helloworld.js application consists of multiple node components organized into four categories: Noise & Heightfields, Agent & Behavior Systems, Simulation & Natural Systems, and Structural / Generative Grammars. Each node processes inputs and generates outputs that can be connected to other nodes to create complex procedural content. The nodes communicate through ReactFlow connections, with outputs from one node feeding into inputs of another.
